# time-series-model

Time series models are specifically designed to handle temporal dependence in data, which is a common feature in many real-world datasets. Time series models can capture trends, seasonal patterns, and other complex patterns that may not be captured by other types of models such as linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees.
This article will focus on The Box-Jenkins methodology, also known as the ARIMA modeling approach, which is the most widely used method in time series analysis and forecasting. It was developed by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins in the 1970s. We will describe this process step by step to obtain an appropriate ARIMA model for a given time series.
